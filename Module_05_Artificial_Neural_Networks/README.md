# Artificial Neural Networks

## Topics covered in today's module
* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Hyperparameters
* Forward Pass
* Backpropagation
* Computing accuracy

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Understanding thje inner workings of an  ANN
* How weight matrices are created 
* Sigmoid, softmax, and ReLu function creations
* Backprop, forward pass, optimizer, predit/compute accuracy logic

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* It's hard to follow some of the computational logic and math used to achieve ANNs and took a lot of rereading and deep diving to understand
