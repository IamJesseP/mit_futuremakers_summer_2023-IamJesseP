# Machine Learning

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Machine learning with Scikit-learn
* Decision Trees
* Linear Regression
* Random Forests

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* How to visualize the Iris dataset using Matplotlib, focusing on different features such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
* How to visualize decision tree making using Graphviz from Scikit
* Discussed the Gini index, its role in decision trees, and how it's used to measure the impurity of a node.
* Created decisions trees and random forests

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* I think this assignment really showed how connected foundational math concepts are to machine learning, [this](https://maps.joindeltaacademy.com/?topic=Machine+Learning) resource really emphasized it!
