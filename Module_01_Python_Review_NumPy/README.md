# NumPy

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to NumPy
* Arrays/Matrices
* Matrix operations

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Numpy Arrays and Dimensions: Talked about numpy arrays and their dimensions. Understood that in numpy, dimensions are also referred to as axes, and the number of axes is called rank. For a 2D array, axis-0 refers to the rows and axis-1 refers to the columns, in a 3D array there is depth, rows, and colummsn (axis-0, axis-1, axis-2).
* Array Transposition: Learned how to use the np.transpose() function to rearrange the dimensions of an array. Learned that the function takes a tuple representing the new order of axes.
* Matrix Multiplication and Other Ops: Learned how matrix multiplication works through the dot product operation.Examined the step-by-step process of the multiplication operation to clarify the concept, reviewed other matrix operations.
## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* I was completely new to working with arrays that are not 1 dimensional. It's very exciting to be able to understand and operate on higher dimension arrays. I had the most trouble understanding transposing, but it solidifed the relation of dimensions and axes in numPy.
